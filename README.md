那天我在上课，忽然觉得有个人影在后窗一闪，好像就停在了窗外。一点动静也没有，也就没太在意，就继续上课了。记得那节课讲的是日本作家壶井荣的《蒲公英》，我特别喜欢的一篇散文，于是我给学生范读课文。也许那天情绪特别好吧，我读得格外投入。似乎文中的蒲公英变成了现实中的自己，自己也成了随处飞的小灯笼。教室里鸦雀无声，只有我时而低缓时而急促的声音如涓涓的溪流向四处流荡着。当我读到“须知，你们是从被践踏、被蹂躏里，勇敢地生活下来的，今后再遭践踏、再遭蹂躏，还得勇敢地生活下去”的时候，我再也抑制不住心中的感动，泪水盈满了眼眶，声音也变得发颤了。讲台下传来几个学生的啜泣声。我知道，他们是真实地被感动了。我示意学生不要哭，可是让我惊讶的是还有低低的啜泣声，却是从窗外传过来的。
以规模为例，将有指导。不可否认的是，有许多让我们叹息的东西：喜马拉雅山，格陵兰舞，大海，但即使是地球上最华丽的修改，也必须在规模前收敛。这是规模的力量，这使得世界上的一切，屈服，没有什么可以击败它，它使人类不能征服全世界。一个高层建筑，不可能超过地球;火车，不可能生长赤道;飞机，飞行不会超过光速。限制它们，它是比例。
　　这首词是宋代词人张先的典范大作，全首词写的是当恋情蒙受了妨碍后爆发的一种幽愤之情以及对恋情的坚忍信奉。这首词的上片写的是季春时的局面，来创造了一种浓厚的感慨氛围；下片则是抒怀，将本人本质的一种愁展现得是酣畅淋漓的。天不会老去，恋情就不会中断，你我的两颗心犹如被两张用情丝结成的网给纠葛在了一道，情丝结成的情网中有你我千万万万个情绪。
With the storm, and has strong life and secure loyal faith, your pain in contains its own contradictions, terrible is not the enemy but to kill each other, but no pain, no transcendence.
/ > disappeared in the depths of the memory (5 questions) gong gong's house bay bay I come to home gong bay from the country.
Actually bay gong home also is the countryside, but it belongs to the village in the city, and I naturally remote poor hometown very different, at least I can buy here you need stamps, envelopes and writing paper.
Besides a paper notice let me packing alone came to gong house bay, after all, is the beginning of another kind of life I.
I live here one is 3 years.
Home for three years, gong bay, I always thought it was an inn in my life, live here the first day of the foot, I realized that he will one day leave home gong bay and the city.
Because I like destined is a homeless person - my hometown - the piece of loess tableland, no matter how poor, how remote, how block, but it is a part of my heart can't give up forever, is my soul to rely on a harbor.
However, gong's bay for three years, in the days of my brilliant youth.
So, gong bay is a beautiful porcelain in my life, for me the best time.
I seldom go out here, but I have two good friends: poetry and an old guitar.
This is for three years, I with a sincere heart of devotion for three years.
Now think of oneself in the narrow, crowded, dirty collective dormitory meditation to read and write poetry, I really worry about there is no such a day in the future.
In the currents of life, I have been forced back to the busy in the world of heavy and complicated, at the same time also mediocre.
But I can't bear to see step by step and leave me, not only the needs of the lonely, also is a necessary part of my soul;
There is an old guitar, it was hanging on the wall of my home now, look at me all the time, the appearance, more like who love me and looked at me -- it is actually a girl to accompany me through the long march, let I touched, also let me happiness, more let me know that song is about a heart drift of gentle and considerate stroke at a time.
Now, however, I have left the gong bay, only in this little town Xuan miscellaneous blundering miss the gong bay and gone three years.
However, someday, I'll go for a walk home gong bay, after three years in my life to take a walk on the land and use memory, picking up her youth and lost dreams.
Last night, tomorrow is a school leaving date, the same day as the friends to each rush thing.
The whole school, for graduates, is full of miss and miss.
And tonight, are we in gong bay last night.
At nine o 'clock in the evening, everyone meets at the piece of the lawn behind the teaching building.
A class of students, a not a few.
Than any a rally on time, is come.
Lawn, have filled with beer, melon seeds, kettle and tea cups, there are a few guitar and bed blanket.
Tonight, we will be spent in the lawn, between the grass and the moonlight, spend our last night in home gong bay, through to our college life last night.
But no one can say a few words of introduction, because this moment, any language seems to also can't let everyone calm down mood.
All in silence began slowly, also can start in silence.
Everyone in a long after the handshake, blessing and singing.
I volunteered to under extremely low mood sang a, even for a few years old but eventually friend respectively, also be a wave of my university life.
I sing is the campus folk songs in the slightly bitter hatred of the "youth".
I think, no matter who, left here three years of his youth, here also have a passionate and free days.
And tonight I really like the lyrics written, with the gentle wind, a cloud, also have our dream, gently.
And faint moonlight to visit here, as a blessing from the heaven.
Everything is happy tonight, and tomorrow, tomorrow we will be on the way.
Later, I worked in a poem wrote home gong bay last night/I in the middle of the friends/like a silent stone/waiting for the storm to come.
But before the storm, but had a moonlight, had chenyang, have a good mood and feeling.
So, when we are in a storm in the future, if you recall the night, no matter how difficult, how tired I am, we face, will certainly knowing smile.
Drinking before came to gong house bay, I am not drinking alcohol.
But I only in gong bay in society with drinking.
Drink in gong house bay, it is unique.
A few friends in a small pub casually, or the steamed bread hill behind the school, can drink drink.
After that one drink empty bottles, are witnesses of our youth.
When I found in a variety of YingChouXing party now, I am very miss that time drinking atmosphere and emotional appeal.
Sometimes I also a person to drink.
Three YangChuan in that I often go to the hometown of red bull restaurant, a bottle of wine, a plate of dish - either cold cucumber, either cold three wire, simple, but you can give me a good let me meditation time: I found in beer foam from the nothingness of life, I saw from the liquor in operas of the hardships of life, wine, in my heart, it is not only a kind of liquid, it is my one of the keys to open the door to the world, is one of my heart alone lost hopes and a kind of an outlet.
I will never forget his once for a beloved girl alone drinking scene and mood.
Is the wine made me feel the pain of love and sweet, also let me have a kind of feelings an outlet.
Write poetry, but expressed a part of my heart, but more hidden -- only wine, even said that only drunk to free it.
In this sense, drunk, is the liberation of our inner within a pile of worries.
Love letters in bay gong home for three years, I not only wrote numerous poems, also wrote numerous letters.
Huang hebei she live, I live Huang Hena, separated by a river, let I miss and cared about the hills lie between water and GuaGuo on a piece of a piece of white paper.
She later told me that the university three years, she received a total of more than one hundred letters.
I also know that a letter on Monday, is almost my emotions.
Because I can't disguise his own heart, I need a talk.
This day and age, is a busy time, is also a lack of talk time, but I had the opportunity to, she can read my every word, so, I often think, she and I, should be the ear and sound relationship.
Wherever I go, or a recluse, the voice of my heart will be listening to it, I also drink at themselves can exist in these words sincerely.
If after ten years, or longer some time, when I read the squares of the author's words, I don't know if I was the cry, or smile.
But at least I can be sure: I have loved.
Yes, more than one hundred letters, it is my sincere love.
Last fall to a review in leaves the flying days, I can't write down the words about autumn.
Only in spring flowers fragrant, the autumn bleak, bleak and empty will mysterious tunnel through time, more desolate in the memory, more beautiful.
I am a person living on memories.
I like to put everything away some distance, to see it again.
Like me across the window overlooking a faint mountains cragginess, distance, let me approach, understanding the beauty.
Such as a review of last fall.
It was a very sad day.
Like the wind blowing leaves fall, the earth is only an empty;
My heart, only her departure.
The receding figure, was born the innumerable shenzhen at night.
A cup of wine, a pack of cigarettes, a picture of a sad countenance and a heart to cry.
For me, last year's autumn, only these.
I was realy with blood, passion, youth singing elegy for yourself.
I also use words singing elegy.
In late at night I wrote numerous poems first sorrow.
These words, is to see her off and blessing, is also for your own comfort and touch.
Every word, is unable to give up my inner world of a piece of flesh.
Like the birds leave the forest, like white clouds cannot leave a high altitude, more like she cannot leave me.
So, in the text is more of a mushy retain: I open the door to let the fire burns in the corner/blue flame/is our warm home.
Now, when I review last fall, has walked away feet, the twists and turns of love, flashing light, the light of the full of happiness, in front of my eyes.
